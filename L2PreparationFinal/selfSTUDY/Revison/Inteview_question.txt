Q) How will you automate CAPTCHA?
This question can be asked because of 2 reasons.
1. The interviewer does not have a clue what he is asking.
2. Interviewer is tricking you to get your response.

Answer part 1:

CAPTCHA's sole goal is to avoid bots/automation.
You do not automate it!

Then the interview may ask that their app uses captcha before logging in, so you mean we should not automate it? Some interviewers may become
aggressive or even hostile.

Answer part 2:
I am not saying that we should not automate it. The correct way to handle CAPTCHA is to disable them  in the lower test environments eg. QA, staging etc.
And before you go to production perhaps in a pre-prod environment you check with CAPTCHA enabled manually, just once.
This way you will have best of all worlds.

Q)What is Page Object Model (POM)?

1. It is a UI test automation design pattern.
2. It basically says: We map every page/screen of the AUT(application under test) with a class/file in your test automation framework.
3. Each class/file contains all the elements present in that page/screen of AUT as well as all the methods that interact with those elements.
