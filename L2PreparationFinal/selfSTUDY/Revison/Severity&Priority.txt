-Priority indicates how soon the bug should be fixed whereas Severity indicates the seriousness of the defect on the product functionality.
-Priority is the order in which the developer should resolve a defect whereas Severity is the degree of impact that a defect has on the operation
  of the product.
-High Priority and low severity status indicates, defect have to be fixed on immediate bases but does not affect the application while
 High Severity and low priority status indicates defect have to be fixed but not on immediate bases.
-Priority status is based on customer requirements whereas Severity status is based on the technical aspect of the product.
-A Quality Assurance engineer usually determines the severity level of a bug/defect.

**Diffrence between Smoke And Sanity:

     -Smoke Testing is scripted, which means it can be documented,    sanity testing is unscripted, which implies that it cannot be documented.
     -Smoke testing is considered shallow and wide testing,           sanity testing is considered narrow and deep testing.
     -Smoke testing takes all important features and performs         sanity testing takes some very significant features and 
       high-level testing                                              performs deep testing.
     -Smoke testing is executed as soon as the build is installed     sanity testing is implemented as soon as the bug fixes are done.

#      		 Static Testing	                                			 Dynamic Testing
  It is performed in the early stage of the software development.	It is performed at the later stage of the software development.
  In static testing whole code is not executed.	                        In dynamic testing whole code is executed.
  Static testing prevents the defects.	                                Dynamic testing finds and fixes the defects.
  Static testing is performed before code deployment.			Dynamic testing is performed after code deployment.
  Static Testing involves checklist for testing process.		Dynamic Testing involves test cases for testing process.
  It includes walkthroughs, code review, inspection etc.		It involves functional and nonfunctional testing.
  Example:  Verification                                                Example:Validation  

# diffrence between DDL and DML?
-                        DDL	                                                                   DML
   It stands for Data Definition Language.	                           It stands for Data Manipulation Language.
   DDL does not use WHERE clause in its statement.	                   While DML uses WHERE clause in its statement.
   DDL is used to define the structure of a database.	                   DML is used to manipulate the data within the database.
   DDL statements do not change the contents of the database.	           DML statements change the contents of the database.
   Examples of DDL commands: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, 	   Examples of DML commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE.
      TRUNCATE TABLE, and RENAME TABLE.

Q) truncate vs delete in sql?
-  *The DELETE command is used to delete particular records from a table. The TRUNCATE command is used to delete the complete data from the table.
   *Delete is a DML command whereas Truncate is a DDL
   *Delete can be use with Where clause whereas Truncate does not use WHERE clause.
