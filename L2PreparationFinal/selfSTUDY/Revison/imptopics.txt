 TDD ->
 First we will be having test layer->this involves the test cases covering the application under test. All the test logic is present here.
 then we will be having core/implementataion layer -> here we will be having pages, commoun utilities(waits,logger,browser, exception etc)
 service layer - here all the logic are grouped, which help in reuasibility, better code maintainnace.
 then will be having resource/test data layer -> driver,logs, excel file, config files, scrren shot

 Api framework->
 will be having 2 layers
 1. webservice layer
 2. test layer
