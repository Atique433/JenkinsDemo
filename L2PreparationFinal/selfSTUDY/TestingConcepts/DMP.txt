Defect - Deviation from requirement
Bug    - Informal name of defects, (A coding error) 
Error  - The Problem in code leads to errors.
Failure- Many defects lead to the software's 

Q)What is Defect Management Process?
- Defect Management is a systematic process to identify and fix bugs.
   (OR) 
 The Defect Management Process is an iterative process that continues throughout the software development life cycle, and helps to ensure
 that defects are identified, tracked, and resolved in a timely and efficient manner, leading to higher software quality and reliability.

 A defect management cycle contains the following stages
 1) Discovery of Defect,
 2) Defect Categorization
 3) Fixing of Defect by developers
 4) Verification by Testers,
 5) Defect Closure
 6) Defect Reports at the end of project

 1.Discovery - In the discovery phase, the project teams have to discover as many defects as possible, before the end customer can discover it.
               A defect is said to be discovered and change to status accepted when it is acknowledged and accepted by the developers

 2.Categorization - Defect categorization help the software developers to prioritize their tasks. That means that this kind of priority helps the
                    developers in fixing those defects first that are highly crucial.

 3.Defect Resolution - Defect resolution process starts with assigning defects to developers, then developers schedule the defect to be fixed as
                      per priority, then defects are fixed and finally developers send a report of resolution to the test manager. This process 
                      helps to fix and track defects easily.

    Assignment -> Shedule Fixing -> Fix the defect -> report solution

 4.Verification - After the development team fixed and reported the defect, the testing team verifies that the defects are actually resolved.

 5.Closure - Once a defect has been resolved and verified, the defect is changed status as closed. If not, you have send a notice to the development
             to check the defect again.

 6.Defect Reporting - In software testing is a process in which test managers prepare and send the defect report to the management team for feedback
                     on defect management process and defects’ status. Then the management team checks the defect report and sends feedback or provides
                     further support if needed. Defect reporting helps to better communicate, track and explain defects in detail.

# Important Defect Metrics:-

Q) How to measure and evaluate the quality of the test execution?
-  There are 2 parameters which you can consider as following

   1.defection rejection ratio (DRR) is 20/84 = 0.238 (23.8 %).
   2.defect leakage ratio (DLR) is 20/64 = 0.312 (31.2 %).

# RCA:

Q)What Is Root Cause Analysis?
- RCA (Root Cause Analysis) is a mechanism of analyzing the Defects, to identify its cause. We brainstorm, read and dig the defect to identify whether
  the defect was due to “testing miss”, “development miss” or was a “requirement or designs miss”.

- Advantages Of Root Cause Analysis

Prevent the reoccurrence of the same problem in the future.
Eventually, reduce the number of defects reported over time.
Reduces developmental costs and saves time.
Improve the software development process and hence aiding quick delivery to market.
Improves customer satisfaction.
Boost productivity.
Find hidden problems in the system.
Aids in continuous improvement.
