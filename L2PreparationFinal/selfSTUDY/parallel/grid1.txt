# *DesiredCapabilites is used to set the type of browser and OS that we will automate.
  *RemoteWebDriver is used to set which node (or machine) that our test will run against.

#Selenium Grid - Selenium Grid uses a hub-node concept where we only run the test on a single machine called a hub,
                 but the execution will be done by different machines called nodes. 

#The hub and nodes communicate with each other using a JSON wire protocol.

#connect to HUB-.
  java -jar selenium-server-standalone-4.7.2.jar -role hub   //-> sel 3
  java -jar selenium-server-4.7.2.jar hub

#Connect to node 
  java -jar selenium-server-4.7.2.jar node

# for having multiple node for same host -> java -jar selenium-server-4.7.2.jar node --port 5554

#command to connect to diffrent machine : java -> driver path ->node command.jar -> hub url -> port number

->java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="C:\Users\Atique_Rahman\Desktop\selenium\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe" -jar selenium-server-4.7.2.jar 
   node --hub http://192.168.1.16:4444/grid/register --port 5566

->java -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver="C:\\Users\\Atique_Rahman\\Desktop\\Selenium_gecko\\geckodriver-v0.32.0-win32\\geckodriver.exe" -jar selenium-server-4.7.2.jar node --hub http://192.168.1.11:4444/grid/register --port 4546

#Status can be checked by using the web interface--localhost:4444/grid/console

#For Instance, if you want to use only IE/firefox/chrome you can start the node by using below command:

  IE     - java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar -role webdriver -hub
           http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5556 -browser browserName=iexplore

  FireFox- java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar -role webdriver -hub
           http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5556 -browser browserName=firefox

  Chrome - java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar -role webdriver -hub
           http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5556 -browser browserName=chrome

Q) Benefits of grid/ when to use it?

- 1.What if you want to execute your test cases for different Operating Systems?
  2.How to run your test cases in the different version of the same browser?
  3.How to run your test cases in multiple browsers?
  4.Why should a scenario wait for the execution of other test cases even if it does not depend upon any test cases?

Q) challenges/problem in selenium grid?
-> Not being able to connect to the grid
   Nodes going offline unexpectedly
   Browsers not launching correctly
   Tests taking too long to run
   Tests failing for no apparent reason

Q) diffrence between MaxInstances and MaxSession

-  1. MaxInstances: It is the no. of browser instances (of the same versions) that can run on the remote machine. Check the below commands.
       -browser browserName=firefox,version=59,maxInstances=3,platform=WINDOWS
       -browser browserName=InternetExplorer,version=11,maxInstances=3,platform=WINDOWS

    It means we can run three instances of both Firefox and IE at the same time. So, a total of six different browsers (FF & IE) could run in parallel.

   2. MaxSession: It dictates how many browsers (independent of the type & version) can run concurrently on the remote machine. It supersedes
                  the “MaxInstances” setting.
       In the previous example: If the value of “maxSession” is one, then no more than a single browser would run. While its value is two,
       then any of these combinations (2FF, 2IE, 1FF+1IE) can run at a time.

Q) Can you explain what a Jenkins pipeline is in the context of Selenium Grid?
-> A Jenkins pipeline is a set of tasks that can be run in order to automate the testing and deployment of applications.
   In the context of Selenium Grid, a Jenkins pipeline can be used to automatically run Selenium tests on a grid of machines
   in order to speed up the testing process.

Q) Selenium grid configuration using JSON File:
-  JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is a standard format used for interchange of data between browser and the web server.
   Selenium has an in-built JSON config file that can be used to set up selenium grid.

Q)In how many ways we can run tests in
Q)testNG paralell vs grid?

# syntax:
  DesiredCapabilities dc = new DesiredCapabilities();
  dc.setBrowser("chrome");
  dc.setPlatform(platform.WIN10);
  RemoteWebdriver driver = new RemoteWebdriver(new URL (host),dc);
