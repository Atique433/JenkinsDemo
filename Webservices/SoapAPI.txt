Q) What is Web Service?
-  Web Service is a standard software system used for communication between two devices (client and server) over the network.
   Web services provide a common platform for various applications written in different languages to communicate with each other over the network.

  There are mainly two types of web services.
   1.SOAP web services.
   2.RESTful web services.

Q) What is SOAP?
-> SOAP is an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers.
   SOAP is an application of the XML specification.
   # Points to Note
  *SOAP is a communication protocol designed to communicate via Internet.
  *SOAP can extend HTTP for XML messaging.
  *SOAP provides data transport for Web services.
  *SOAP can exchange complete documents or call a remote procedure.
  *SOAP can be used for broadcasting a message.
  *SOAP is platform- and language-independent.
  *SOAP is the XML way of defining what information is sent and how.
  *SOAP enables client applications to easily connect to remote services and invoke remote methods.

# Other frameworks including CORBA, DCOM, and Java RMI provide similar functionality to SOAP, but SOAP messages are written entirely in XML.

Q) What are the elements of SOAP message structure?
-  It is an ordinary XML document that contains the elements as a SOAP message

   Envelope: It defines the start and end of the message
   Header: It is an optional element. Contains information about the message being sent
   Body: It contains the XML data comprising the message being sent
   Fault: It provides the information about errors occurred while processing the message

Q) Mention what is the difference between JSON and SOAP?
-  JSON is standard to represent human readable data. SOAP is a protocol requirement for transmitting information and calling web-services using XML.

Q) Mention what is the difference between SOAP web service and RESTful web service?
-  SOAP: In SOAP, communication between the client and web service happens using XML message. It specifies the communication rules like what are all
         the tags that should be used in XML and their meaning
-  RestFul: It uses architecture which use HTTP or similar protocols by restricting the interface to use standard operations like GET, PUT, POST,
            DELETE for HTTP.

Q) Mention what is the transport method in SOAP?
-  Application layer and transport layers of a network are used by SOAP.
   HTTP and SMTP are the valid application layer protocol used as transport for SOAP.
   HTTP is more preferable as it works well with current internet infrastructure especially with firewalls. The SOAP requests can be sent via an HTTP GET
   method while the specification includes details on HTTP POST only.

Q) Mention what is the end point in web services?
-  IP address of the server where the web services are running is the end point in web services.

Q) Mention what is the message format used in SOAP?

-   POST/InStock HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost (www.xyz.org)
    Content Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
    Content length: 300
    SOAPAction:http://www.guru99.org/2003/05/soap-envelop>
    <?xml version= “1.0”?>
    <soap:Envelop xmlns:soap= http://www.guru99.org/2003/05/soap-envelop>
    <soap:Header>
    </soap:Header>
    <soap:Body>
    <m:CareerName>Guru99</m:CareerName>
    </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>

Q) How do users utilize the facilities provided by SOAP?

-  PutAddress(): It is used to enter an address in the webpage and has an address instance on the SOAP call.
   PutListing(): It is used to allow the insertion of a complete XML document into the web page.
   GetAddress(): It is used to get a query name and gets the result that best matches a query.
   GetAllListing(): It is used to return the full list in an XML format.

Q) What are the syntax rules for a SOAP message?

-  Must use encoded XML
   Envelope namespace must be used
   Encoding namespace must be used
   Must not consist of a DTD reference
   Must not have XML processing instruction

Q) What are the advantages of SOAP web services?

  WS Security          - SOAP defines its security known as WS Security.
  Language Independent - Its web services can be written in any programming language
  Platform Independent - Its web services can be executed on any platform.

Q) What is WSDL?
-  The WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language. It is an XML document containing information about web services such as method name,
   method parameter. The Client needs a data dictionary which contains information about all the web services with methods names and parameters
   list to invoke them for the web services. The Web Service Description Language bridge up this gap, by providing all necessary information to the client.

Q) What is the difference between SOAP and REST web services?

->	           SOAP	                                              REST
                  -------                                           --------
1)   SOAP is a protocol.	                          REST is an architectural style.
2)   SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.	  REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
3)   SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.	  REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP.
4)   SOAP permits XML data format only.	                  REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON.

# W3C- governing body for all web standards.

# 1.Marshalling   - The client would format the information regarding the procedure call and any arguments into a SOAP message and sends it to the
                    server as part of an HTTP request. This process of encapsulating the data into a SOAP message was known as Marshalling.
  2.Demarshalling - The server would then unwrap the message sent by the client, see what the client requested for and then send the appropriate
                    response back to the client as a SOAP message. The practice of unwrapping a request sent by the client is known as Demarshalling

# SOAP - Message Structure:
  ------------------------
 1. SOAP:Envelope - The SOAP envelope indicates the start and the end of the message so that the receiver knows when an entire message has been received.
                    The SOAP envelope solves the problem of knowing when you are done receiving a message and are ready to process it.
                    The SOAP envelope is therefore basically a packaging mechanism. 
      **Points to Note**
         Every SOAP message has a root Envelope element
         Envelope is a mandatory part of SOAP message.
         Every Envelope element must contain exactly one Body element.
         If an Envelope contains a Header element, it must contain no more than one, and it must appear as the first child of the Envelope, before the Body.
         The envelope changes when SOAP versions change.
         The SOAP envelope is specified using the ENV namespace prefix and the Envelope element.

 2. SOAP:Header - The header element can be used to contain information such as authentication information or the definition of complex data types.
      **Points to Note**
         It is an optional part of a SOAP message.
         Header elements can occur multiple times.
         Headers are intended to add new features and functionality.
         The SOAP header contains header entries defined in a namespace. 
 
      :-A SOAP Header can have the following two attributes −
        1.Actor attribute:By setting the Actor attribute, the client can specify the recipient of the SOAP header.
        2.MustUnderstand attribute:It indicates whether a Header element is optional or mandatory.By setting to true/false

 3. SOAP:Body - The SOAP body is a mandatory element that contains the application-defined XML data being exchanged in the SOAP message.

 4. SOAP:Fault - If an error occurs during processing, the response to a SOAP message is a SOAP fault element in the body of the message,
                 and the fault is returned to the sender of the SOAP message.
               - The SOAP fault mechanism returns specific information about the error, including a predefined code, a description,
                 and the address of the SOAP processor that generated the fault.
      **Points to Note**
        A SOAP message can carry only one fault block.
        Fault is an optional part of a SOAP message.
        For HTTP binding, a successful response is linked to the 200 to 299 range of status codes.
        SOAP Fault is linked to the 500 to 599 range of status codes.

# SOAP - Encoding :-
  ------------------
      -SOAP includes a built-in set of rules for encoding data types. It enables the SOAP message to indicate specific data types,
       such as integers, floats, doubles, or arrays.
      -SOAP data types are divided into two broad categories − scalar types and compound types.
      -Scalar types contain exactly one value such as a last name, price, or product description.
      -Compound types contain multiple values such as a purchase order or a list of stock quotes.
      -Compound types are further subdivided into arrays and structs.
      -The encoding style for a SOAP message is set via the SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle attribute.

# SOAP - Transport :-
  -------------------
    SOAP is not tied to any transport protocol. SOAP can be transported via SMTP, FTP, IBM's MQSeries, or Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ).
    SOAP specification includes details on HTTP only. HTTP remains the most popular SOAP transport protocol.

  **SOAP via HTTP-
    Quite logically, SOAP requests are sent via an HTTP request and SOAP responses are returned within the content of the HTTP response.
    Both HTTP requests and responses are required to set their content type to text/xml
