Q) What is an Idempotent API?
-  In the context of REST APIs, when making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request – then that REST API
   is called idempotent.

Q) What is an Idempotent HTTP Method?
-  An idempotent HTTP method is a method that can be invoked many times without the different outcomes. It should not matter if the method has
   been called only once, or ten times over. The result should always be the same.

# Idempotency with HTTP Methods:-

  1.POST- POST APIs are used to create a new resource on the server. So when we invoke the same POST request N times, we will have N new 
          resources on the server. So, POST is not idempotent.

  2.GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE- This methods NEVER change the resource state on the server. They are purely for retrieving the resource
                                  representation or metadata at that point in time.
          So invoking multiple requests will not have any write operation on the server, so GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are idempotent.

  3.PUT- PUT APIs are used to update the resource state. If you invoke a PUT API N times, the very first request will update the resource;
         the other N-1 requests will just overwrite the same resource state again and again – effectively not changing anything.
         Hence, PUT is idempotent.

  4.DELETE- When you invoke N similar DELETE requests, the first request will delete the resource and the response will be 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content).
            Other N-1 requests will return 404 (Not Found).Clearly, the response is different from the first request, but there is no change of state
            for any resource on the server-side because the original resource is already deleted.So, DELETE is idempotent.
 
Q) Put vs Patch?
-                            PUT                                                         	      PATCH                                                        
1. PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client            PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that
   sends data that updates the entire resource .                     is to be updated without modifying the entire data.
2. if record found it will modify else create it.                    If the record is not there is will throw an error.
3. We send the entire resource when making a PUT request.            Need to send only the resource to modify

Q)             PUT	                                                                             POST

1.This method is idempotent. This means it will produce the same results	 -This method is not idempotent. It produces different results 
  the same results if executed more than once.                                    every time it is executed.
2.When we need to modify a single resource that is already part of 	         -POST method is called when a child resource is to be added 
  resource collection, we call the PUT method.                                    under resources collection.
3.PUT method syntax : PUT /questions/{question-id}	                         -POST method syntax: POST /questions
4.Put method makes use of the "UPDATE" query.	                                 -POST method makes use of the "CREATE" query.
5.PUT /vi/cake/orders/1234 indicates updation of a resource	                 -POST /vi/cake/orders* indicate that we are creating a new resource 
  identified by "1234".                                                           and return an identifier to describe the resource.

# REST defines 6 architectural constraints/Guiding Principles which make any web service – a true RESTful API.

-1.Uniform interface – The uniform interface constraint defines the interface between clients and servers. It simplifies and decouples
                       the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently.

 2.Client–server - This constraint essentially means that client applications and server applications MUST be able to evolve separately
                    without any dependency on each other. A client should know only resource URIs, and that’s all.

 3.Stateless - The server will not store anything about the latest HTTP request the client made. It will treat every request as new.
                No session, no history.

 4.Cacheable – Caching refers to storing the server response in the client itself, so that a client need not make a server request for the
               same resource again and again
 
 5.Layered system - A layered system provides a hierarchical structure between a client and a server. There can be a lot of intermediaries between 
                    the client and the server working along with REST API without the client's notice. Our clients think there is a direct connection
                    to the server. We then take advantage of it to improve our architecture and bring down our distributed system complexity. 

 6.Code-on-demand - The client can send a request to the server asking for the code and then the server will respond with some code in the form of
                    a script or some other entity. For example, servers can extend the client functionality by downloading and executing pre-compiled 
                    code like an applet or a client-side script like JavaScript. 

Q) How do you perform chaining in REST Assured?
-  In the context of object-oriented programming languages, method chaining is used to invoke multiple method calls. Each method returns an object,
   which allows multiple calls to be chained into a single line that doesn’t require variables to hold interim results.
            
         given()
           .baseUri(baseUri)
           .queryParam(parameterName, parameterValues)
           .accept(contentType).
           .when()
           .then();

Q) What is JSONPath?
-  JSONPath is a query language for JSON, similar to XPath for XML. It allows you to select and extract data from a JSON document.
   You use a JSONPath expression to traverse the path to an element in the JSON structure.

      Response employeesResponse = RestAssured.given().request(Method.GET, "/all");
      JsonPath jsonPathObj = employeesResponse.jsonPath();

     //get a list of all employees id:
     List<String> employeeIds = jsonPathObj.get("company.employee.id");
     //get the first employee name:
     String empName = jsonPathObj.get("company.employee[0].name");

Q) How do you log a request and response in case REST Assured fails a validation?
-  If the test validation fails, log().ifValidationFails() will log everything in a request and response.

Q) What are serialization and deserialization in the context of Java?
-  Serialization is defined as the process of changing an object's state into a byte stream. On the other hand, deserialization is
   the process of recreating the Java object in memory using the byte stream. This approach keeps the object alive. A serialized 
   object can be stored in files, external sources, databases etc and can also be transferred over networks.

 --POJO: Plain Old Java Object We generally use POJOs to create JSON payload and convert JSON response payload to Java objects.
   Converting a POJO object to a JSON object is Serialization and converting a JSON object to a POJO object is called deserialization.
   These conversions can be done with help of Java libraries like Jackson, Gson etc. We don’t need to implement the required interfaces for POJO classes.

Q) List the core components of an HTTP request.
-  An HTTP request consists of five elements:

   1.An action (DELETE, GET, POST). This element shows HTTP methods.
   2.A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This element identifies the resource on the server.
   3.The HTTP version.
   4.A request header. This element carries the metadata for the message. The metadata could be a format supported by the client,
                       message body format, browser or client type, cache settings, etc.
   5.Request body. This element indicates the resource representation or message content.

Q) What is messaging in RESTful Web services?
-  RESTful web services use the HTTP protocol as a communication tool between the client and the server

Q) How to validate the response time of the request using rest assured?

-  By using a simple long matcher.

    RestAssured.given().baseUri("http://localhost:4001").contentType(ContentType.JSON).log().all()
		.when().get("/users").then().time(lessThan(5000L)

Q) What is the difference between path params and query params and how to use them?

-  Path params are used to identify resources on the server while query params are used to sort/filter resources. Query params are
   key-value-like pairs that appear after the question mark in the URL while path params come before the question mark.

   How to pass Path Param:
	RestAssured.given()
	  .pathParam("user", "users/qaautomatonhub")

   How to pass query Param:
        RestAssured.given()
                .queryParam("sort","created")
                .queryParam("direction","desc")

Q) Explain the Request specification and response in Rest Assured.

-  Request Specification and Response both are rest assured interfaces. Request specification allows specifying how the request will look like.
   The request Specification Interface has methods to define the base URL, base path, headers, body, etc. The response interface extends
   ResponseBody, and ResponseOptions interfaces and uses to return a response to the request.

# Request Specification - RequestSpecification interface provided by Rest Assured is used to club and extract repetitive actions like setting up
                          base URL, headers, HTTP verbs etc which may be common for multiple Rest calls.

# Response Specification - ResponseSpecification interface comes handy in situation where similar set of assertions need to be done for several
                           Rest requests. It achieves this by grouping common assertions into a ResponseSpecBuilder instance and using this instance
                           for validations in multiple tests.

Q) how do you specify that the response should be of a particular type when sending the request?
-  Media type (aka MIME type) specifies the format of the data as type/subtype e.g. text/html, text/xml, application/json, image/jpeg etc.
   In HTTP request, MIME type is specified in the request header using Accept and Content-Type attribute. The Accept header attribute specifies
   the format of response data which the client expects and the Content-Type header attribute specifies the format of the data in the request body 
   so that receiver can parse it into appropriate format.

  By default, the Web API framework supports two media types: JSON and XML. When you issue a request with Accept: application/json, then the response
  message will be JSON and the Content-Type will be set to application/json. Similarly, if you issue a request with Accept: application/xml, then the
  response message will be XML and the Content-Type will be set to application/xml.

Q) What do you understand by JAX-RS?
-  As the name itself stands (JAX-RS= Java API for RESTful Web Services) is a Java-based specification defined by JEE for the implementation
   of RESTful services.
